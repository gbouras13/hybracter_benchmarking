Benchmarking Pipeline for `hybracter`

This directory contains the pipeline used to benchmark [hybracter](https://github.com/gbouras13/hybracter).

I used [Snaketool](https://github.com/beardymcjohnface/Snaketool) to make this, and would highly recommend it!

It should work 'out of the box' for the simulated reads. For the real read sets, you will need to change the `csv` input files in this directory with the correct FASTQ paths of the required files on your system.
